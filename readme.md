# Habit Streak, a WordPress Plugin

**In progress**

This is a very simple WIP plugin to see how long your daily posting streak has been going on. It's also an experiment to see how far I can get using Github Copilot and not writing the code myself...

Right now it stops at 100 posts and has some other wierd quirks.

## Todos

- [ ] Add a settings page to set the content type
- [ ] Show the updated streak on the block editors post-publish panel
- [ ] Add caching, deal with 100 batch limit
- [ ] Add post publish actions to update the streak programmatically
- [ ] Add an option to ignore specific days/weekends when counting the streak
